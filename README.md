# Machine Learning Exercises (version 2018)

This repository contains a set of excercises prepared for the 2017 version of
the [Machine Learning course](http://compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/vyuka/ml/) offered
at the [Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics](https://fmph.uniba.sk/)
of [Comenius University](https://uniba.sk/) in Bratislava, Slovakia. It
consists of a number of Jupyter notebooks and associated Python files.

The course goes provides an intoduction into the field of Machine Learning,
while these excercises aim to give an opportunity to get practical experience
with some of the [most often used](https://polygraph-cool.github.io/kaggle_survey/#what)
methods.

## Using the repository

In order to use this repository, it needs to be downloaded first. If `git` is
available, this can be done as easily as running:

        $ git clone https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/ml_exercises.git

Another option is downloading the .zip file from the following link:

        https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/ml_exercises/archive/master.zip

and extracting it to a `ml_exercises` repository.

## Installing the dependences

It seems that by far the easiest way of getting all required dependences,
especially the [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
is installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Running the notebooks

Once the `jupyter` package has been installed in the previous sections, running
the notebooks should be as easy as running the following in the `ml_exercises`
directory:

        $ jupyter notebook

On Debian boxes, it is advisable to run the following command:

        $ jupyter-notebook

## Issues

Should you run into any problem when trying to set up the environment for
running these notebooks, please feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/ml_exercises/issues) with a detailed
description of your problem.
